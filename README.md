# Text to Speech (TTS) Converter

This project is a simple and effective Text-to-Speech (TTS) tool implemented in Python. It utilizes `gTTS` for cloud-based TTS and `pyttsx3` for offline synthesis, enabling users to convert any input text into spoken audio with configurable voice, rate, and language.

## Features
- Online TTS with Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
- Offline TTS with pyttsx3
- Adjustable speech rate and voice
- Save output audio as `.mp3` files

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `gtts`
- `pyttsx3`
- `IPython` (for playback in notebooks)

## Usage
1. Run the notebook
2. Enter the desired text
3. Choose between online and offline mode
4. Listen or download the audio output

## Future Improvements
- Add GUI for better accessibility
- Support for additional languages and voices
- Integrate speech-to-text for two-way interaction
